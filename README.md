# Homework 06

Homework 6 covers an introduction to the **pandas library**. 

## 01-Animals
The Animals notebook is a very small dataset to get comfortable with pandas syntax. The dataset is small enough that it can be visually checked by printing it out. Basic plotting is also covered, which I still find unintuitive in Python, regardless of the library, but I did attempt to use Altair. I'm interested in learning r and using ggplot2 as the grammar of graphics seems like it has a coherent framework around it and a lot of community. I have been wanting to learn D3 for quite a while and my own work is pushing me towards it, so I would like to learn whatever will be most beneficial to wrap my head around that. I've been using plotly for exploration.

## 02-Billionaires
This is data on the world's richest people by net worth. It has a lot of information about them and we are able to analyze it by country, source of income, gender, etc.
